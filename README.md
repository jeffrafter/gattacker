A Node.js package for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Man-in-the-Middle & more.


## Prerequisites

see:

https://github.com/abandonware/noble

https://github.com/abandonware/bleno


## Install

```sh
npm install gattacker
```

## Usage

### Configure

Running both components Set up variables in config.env:

* NOBLE_HCI_DEVICE_ID : noble ("central", ws-server) device
* BLENO_HCI_DEVICE_ID : bleno ("peripheral", advertise) device

If you run "central" and "peripheral" modules on separate boxes with just one BT4 interface, you can leave the values commented.


* WS_SERVER : IP address of ws-server box
* DEVICES_PATH : path to store json files

### Start "central" device

```sh
sudo node ws-server
```
Connects to targeted peripheral and acts as websocket server.


Debug:

```sh
DEBUG=ws-server sudo node ws-server
```

### Scanning

#### Scan for advertisements

```sh
node scan
```
Without parameters scans for broadcasted advertisements, and records them as json files (.adv.json) in DEVICES_PATH


#### Explore services and characteristics

```sh
node scan <peripheral>
```
Explore services and characteristics of chosen peripheral.
Saves the explored service structure in json file (.srv.json) in DEVICES_PATH.


### Hook configuration (option)

For active request/response tampering configure hook functions for characteristic in device's json services file.

Example:

```javascript
            {
                "uuid": "06d1e5e779ad4a718faa373789f7d93c",
                "name": null,
                "properties": [
                    "write",
                    "notify"
                ],
                "startHandle": 8,
                "valueHandle": 9,
                "endHandle": 10,
                "descriptors": [
                    {
                        "handle": 10,
                        "uuid": "2902",
                        "value": ""
                    }
                ],
                "hooks": {
                    "dynamicWrite": "dynamicWriteFunction",
                    "dynamicNotify": "customLog"
                }
            }
```

Functions:

<dynamic|static><Write|Read|Notify>

 dynamic: connect to original device

 static: do not connect to original device, run the tampering function locally

 It will try to invoke the specified function from hookFunctions, include your own.
 A few examples provided in hookFunctions subdir.

staticValue - static value



### Start "peripheral" device

```sh
node advertise -a <advertisement_json_file> [ -s <services_json_file> ]
```

It connects via websocket to ws-server in order to forward requests to original device.
Static run (-s) sets services locally, does not connect to ws-server. You have to configure the hooks properly.

## MAC address cloning

For many applications it is necessary to clone MAC address of original device.
A helper tool bdaddr from Bluez is provided in helpers/bdaddr.

```sh
cd helpers/bdaddr
make
```

wrapper script:

```sh
./mac_adv -a <advertisement_json_file> [ -s <services_json_file> ]
```

## Dump, replay

Dump files are saved in a path configured by `DUMP_PATH` in config.env (by default `dump`).
More info:
https://github.com/securing/gattacker/wiki/Dump-and-replay

## Troubleshooting

Turn off, cross fingers, try again ;)

### reset device

```sh
hciconfig <hci_interface> reset
```

### Running ws-server and advertise on the same box

With this configuration you may experience various problems.

Try switching NOBLE_HCI_INTERFACE and BLENO_HCI_INTERFACE


### hcidump debug

```sh
hcidump -x -t <hci_interface>
```
